Title of the project: Property Management Application

Brief Description of Problem: The task was to develop a real estate application that allows renters, landlords, and maintenance staff to manage rental properties and service requests. The system needed to handle user registration, authentication, property listing, rent payment, and maintenance requests.

Solution: I developed a Java-based web application for managing rental properties. The application allows anonymous users to view available rental properties and send messages to landlords. Registered users can log in as a renter, landlord, or maintenance worker. Renters can view when their rent is due, submit maintenance requests, and pay rent. Landlords can view the status of their properties, add new property listings, assign users to properties, and assign maintenance requests to employees. They can also upload pictures of a rental property, see when rent is due for all their properties, list an available property, assign a registered renter to a property, and remove a property from the public listing. Maintenance workers can view maintenance requests assigned to them and mark a request as completed. The application also supports admin users who can view and edit renter, landlord, and maintenance worker data.

Role: As the sole developer of this project, I was responsible for designing and implementing all aspects of the application, including user registration, authentication, property listing, rent payment, and maintenance request handling.

Title of the project: TEnmo (Venmo-like money transfer application)

Brief Description of Problem: The task was to develop a Java-based web API for a Venmo-like money transfer application. The system needed to handle user registration, authentication, account balance viewing, money transfer, and transfer history viewing.

Solution: I developed a Java-based web API that allows users to register, log in, view their account balance, send money to other registered users, and view their transfer history. The application ensures that users can't send more money than they have in their account and can't send money to themselves. The application also logs all transactions to prevent theft.

Role: As the sole developer of this project, I was responsible for designing and implementing all aspects of the application, including user registration, authentication, account balance viewing, money transfer, and transfer history viewing.

Title of the project: Vending Machine

Brief Description of Problem: The task was to develop a Java-based vending machine CLI program. The system needed to handle product listing, product selection, money feeding, and transaction logging.

Solution: I developed a Java-based CLI program that simulates a vending machine. The application allows users to view available products, feed money into the machine, select a product to purchase, and receive change. The application ensures that users can't purchase a product if they don't have enough money and can't purchase a product that is sold out. The application also logs all transactions to prevent theft.

Role: As the sole developer of this project, I was responsible for designing and implementing all aspects of the application, including product listing, money feeding, product selection, and transaction logging.
